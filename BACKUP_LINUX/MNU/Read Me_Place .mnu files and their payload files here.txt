This folder should be used for payload files which require a .mnu file.

.mnu files can be found in the '\_ISO\docs\sample mnu files' folder or you can make you own .mnu files.
The name of the folders at the 3rd level (MNU) does not matter, you can change it or add new folders at that level if you wish.

Payload files that are placed at the 2nd level (\_ISO\xxxxxx) are automatically added to the menu by Easy2Boot and require no .mnu file.

Payload files that are placed at the 3rd level or below (e.g. \_ISO\xxxxxx\MNU) 
are not automatically added to the Easy2Boot menu. They require a .mnu file.

.mnu files are detected by Easy2Boot at the 2nd folder level and below (i.e. \_ISO\xxxxxx) and are added
to the menu by Easy2Boot.

If you add a payload file and a .mnu file at the 2nd level (e.g. \_ISO\xxxxxx) then both the .mnu file AND
the payload file will be added to the menu and you will see two menu entries for the one payload file! 
To avoid this, place payload files that have a .mnu file at the 3rd level (\_ISO\xxxxxx\MNU) or below.
Although the .mnu file can be placed at the 2nd level, it is neater to also place the .mnu file in the same
folder as it's payload file.

e.g.

\_ISO\MAINMENU\fred.iso
\_ISO\MAINMENU\MNU\doris.iso
\_ISO\MAINMENU\MNU\doris.mnu
\_ISO\MAINMENU\XTRA\bill.iso
\_ISO\MAINMENU\XTRA\bill.mnu

This will result in 3 entries being added to the Main E2B menu

fred.iso
<the title used in doris.mnu>
<the title used in bill.mnu>
